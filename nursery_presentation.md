  - Children → Others: Weak
- **Why These Matter**:
  - Guides feature selection
  - Explains decision patterns
  - Helps model interpretation
  - Supports policy decisions

## Slide 8: EDA - Key Insights
- **Data Quality**:
  - No missing values

## Slide 9: Data Preparation
- **Steps**:
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Train/test split (80/20)
  - Feature scaling
- **Why Data Preparation**:
  - Machine learning models need numerical inputs
  - Proper splitting ensures reliable evaluation
  - Prevents data leakage
  - Ensures model generalizability

## Slide 10: Model Selection
- **Models Used**:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- **Why These Models**:
  - Decision Tree:
    - Easy to interpret
    - Handles categorical data well
    - Shows decision paths clearly
  - Random Forest:
    - Better accuracy
    - Reduces overfitting
    - Handles non-linear relationships

## Slide 11: Data Distribution Analysis
- **Target Variable Distribution** [Show Group1-1.png]
  - Most common class: "not_recom" (4,320 cases)
  - Second most common: "priority" (4,266 cases)
  - Rarest class: "recommend" (only 2 cases)
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Shows class imbalance
  - Explains why some classes are harder to predict
  - Helps in model selection and evaluation

## Slide 12: Attribute-Class Relationships
- **Stacked Bar Charts Analysis** [Show attribute vs class stacked charts]
  - **Parents' Occupation**:
    - Great pretentious parents tend to get higher priority
    - Usual parents often receive not_recom
  - **Nursery Quality**:
    - Proper nurseries show better outcomes
    - Critical nurseries often lead to not_recom
  - **Form Completion**:
    - Complete forms have better chances
    - Foster care applications show different patterns
  - **Number of Children**:
    - More children often leads to priority
    - Single children show varied outcomes
  - **Housing Conditions**:
