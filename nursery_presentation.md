- **Why This Dataset**:
  - Perfect for classification (predicting admission outcomes)
  - Rich in social and family context
  - Clean and well-structured
  - No privacy concerns (GDPR compliant)
- **Image**: None (Text-based slide)

## Slide 4: Exploratory Data Analysis - Overview
- **Data Structure**:
  - 12,960 total records
  - 8 categorical features
  - 1 target variable (class)
  - No missing values
- **Feature Types**:
  - Parents' occupation
  - Nursery quality
  - Form completion
  - Number of children
  - Housing conditions
  - Financial status
  - Social status
  - Health status
- **Why EDA Matters**:
  - Understanding data patterns
  - Identifying relationships
  - Planning preprocessing steps
  - Guiding model selection

## Slide 5: EDA - Class Distribution
- **Target Variable Analysis** [Show: results/class_distribution_bar.png]
  - "not_recom": 4,320 cases (33.3%)
  - "priority": 4,266 cases (32.9%)
  - "spec_prior": 4,044 cases (31.2%)
  - "very_recom": 328 cases (2.5%)
  - "recommend": 2 cases (0.01%)
- **Key Insights**:
  - Clear class imbalance
  - Three main classes dominate
  - Rare classes need special handling
  - Important for model evaluation

## Slide 6: EDA - Feature Distributions
- **Balanced Features** [Show: results/parents_vs_class_stacked.png, results/has_nurs_vs_class_stacked.png]
  - Parents: Equal distribution (33.3% each)
  - Has_nurs: Five equal categories (20% each)
  - Form: Four equal categories (25% each)
  - Children: Four equal categories (25% each)
- **Why This Matters**:
  - No feature bias
  - Equal representation
  - Fair model training
  - Reliable predictions

## Slide 7: EDA - Key Relationships
- **Feature Importance** [Show: results/feature_importance.png]
  - Health status: Most critical (30%)
  - Financial status: Second most important
  - Social status: Third most important
  - Nursery quality: Moderate importance
- **Correlations** [Show: results/correlation_heatmap.png]
  - Health → Class: Strong positive
  - Finance → Social: Moderate
  - Parents → Housing: Moderate
  - Children → Others: Weak
- **Why These Matter**:
  - Guides feature selection
  - Explains decision patterns
  - Helps model interpretation
  - Supports policy decisions

## Slide 8: EDA - Key Insights
- **Data Quality**:
  - No missing values
  - Well-balanced features
  - Clear categorical structure
- **Predictive Potential**:
  - Strong feature-target relationships
  - Clear decision patterns
  - High classification potential
- **Challenges**:
  - Class imbalance
  - Rare classes
  - Complex interactions
- **Opportunities**:
  - Automated decision support
  - Clear policy guidelines
  - Fair evaluation system
- **Image**: None (Text-based slide)

## Slide 9: Data Preparation
- **Steps**:
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Train/test split (80/20)
  - Feature scaling
- **Why Data Preparation**:
  - Machine learning models need numerical inputs
  - Proper splitting ensures reliable evaluation
  - Prevents data leakage
  - Ensures model generalizability
- **Image**: None (Text-based slide)

## Slide 10: Model Selection
- **Models Used**:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- **Why These Models**:
  - Decision Tree:
    - Easy to interpret
    - Handles categorical data well
    - Shows decision paths clearly
  - Random Forest:
    - Better accuracy
    - Reduces overfitting
    - Handles non-linear relationships
- **Image**: None (Text-based slide)

## Slide 11: Model Performance
- **Confusion Matrix** [Show: results/confusion_matrix.png]
  - Shows prediction accuracy for each class
  - Diagonal elements show correct predictions
  - Off-diagonal elements show misclassifications
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Detailed view of model performance
  - Identifies which classes are confused
  - Helps in model improvement

## Slide 12: Feature Importance
- **Feature Importance Plot** [Show: results/feature_importance.png]
  - Health is the most important feature
  - Finance and social status are next
  - Has_nurs shows moderate importance
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Guides decision-making process
  - Helps in feature selection
  - Provides insights for policy makers

## Slide 13: Model Comparison
- **Decision Tree vs Random Forest**
  - Decision Tree: 99% accuracy
  - Random Forest: 98% accuracy
  - Both perform well but differently
